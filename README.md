Project-2: NJ College Networking

Description: Every year thousands of students across New Jersey are faced with the daunting task of picking which college they'd like to attend.  The choice
can be very tough so anything that could help make the decision easier for them would be appreciated.  We created an app to help students with this by  providing information about various NJ colleges.  Using the collegescorecard API, we were able to provide various important pieces of information about the schools, such as
what majors are offered, tuition costs, and the average salary of graduates.  We also provide an opportunity for networking by including an event calendar functionality, where events that are being held by the college are able to be posted.  We've started this app by focusing on schools in New Jersey, but we do have 
future plans to expand to other states in the US.
